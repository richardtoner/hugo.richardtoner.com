## Five in Focus

### 5. Red Paper Lanterns

I will always consider Red Paper Lanterns to be the best placed track on any album in the Maybeshewill discography. It was the first big left turn from the band on **I Was Here for a Moment, Then I Was Gone**, an album which saw Maybeshewill explore a more melodic sound after the aggressive brand of instrumental music they showcased on their first 2 albums.

Red Paper Lanterns follows on from Take This to Heart, an aggressive introductory track which feels like a natural evolution from the sound of the first 2 albums. It begins calmly with a clean guitar and a xylophone twinkling away in the background. It then gives way to an explosion of sound as the guitars distort and warming synths dart from wall to wall. It is a truly dizzying 50 seconds and then the band withdraws to let you catch your breath amongst the synths and cymbals before re-engaging with a precise tapped guitar lead that drives the song forward to the triumphant climax of the song.

Most of my memories of Maybeshewill will center on their live shows and the camaraderie of their audiences. However, my memories of seeing Red Paper Lanterns live are wholly personal and when I hear the climax of the song I am immediately transported back to the sunshine-drenched ArcTanGent festival in 2015. As the lead guitar soars over the other instruments, so too did the wind and I felt myself close my eyes and just get swept away by the magic of the moment.

### 4. Not for Want of Trying

- Network
- "I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore"
- Masterclass in using a sample to tell a story
- Usually the point in the set where the audience loses their shit
- Double time at 1:23

The eponymous song off the debut album is a masterclass in how to use a spoken word sample. Samples like this are not uncommon in instrumental music, but it is very rare that they are used this effectively.

The sample in question is lifted from the 198? movie, Network. It is a

### 3. Volga

When I first heard Volga, I felt as though there was some hidden meaning behind the song. It sounded almost as if it was a parting gift from the band. This sadly turned out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, as it is the final song in Maybeshewill’s discography.

It is also the most beautiful song they’ve ever written.

The true beauty of instrumental music for me is that you can assign your own meaning and feelings to the songs without any lyrical misdirection. To me, Volga fills me with the sense of an overwhelming loss, but one that is constantly buoyed by hope. The emotive piano that begins the song and plays throughout is the sound of that loss. One that never changes and never waivers, as it is always with you. As the song progresses, other instruments begin to accompany the piano. These to me are the sounds of your loved ones, helping comfort the loss and staying with you throughout it. It is not until the final minute that the piano is all but drowned out, as the other instruments lift you and your spirits far and away from that feeling and leave you with a feeling of hope.

Volga is a song that could easily be mistaken as simple for its slow layered song structure, but it is masterful in its execution. It resonates with you long after it has closed out Fair Youth and is a perfectly fitting way to close out the exceptional recording legacy of Maybeshewell.


### 2. He Films The Clouds Pt. 2

- "Now we're apart, though not through choice. Do we stay mute, or raise our voice?"
- 65daysofstatic similarities - glitchy electronics

### 1. To The Skies From A Hillside

- Crushing
- Frenzied strings which have a haunting quality akin to Clint Mansell's Lux Aeterna
- You keep expecting them to retreat, but it continues to get heavier and heavier until it breaks at 2:30 to piano and tapped guitars.
- It is their masterpiece
